One of my favorite hobbies is design, and for a while now I've been studying and taking small courses about design. I think my favorite thing regarding the process of design is its simplicity. Now, I can understand why some people aren't fond of modern designs, they do look boring compared to the fun and quirky era during the start of the World Wide Web.
