One of my most recently picked up hobbies is graphic design - I've found my self fascinated by small concepts that can completely change how a design is seen or read. Generally, I've never been a great artist, but with the simplicity of modern design, I've found it easy for me to participate. Nowadays, the graphic design world contains more mathematical elements - this is for consistency and accessibility. This shift into minimalism has concerned and upset the masses. So what's the problem?

# Modernization
Modernization is updating something to make it look or work contemporaneously. In this case, designs must be updated to fit our current setting in the world. Designs between apps are kept similar, flyers fit the design of the building they're posted on, social media posts are optimized for each platform's aspect ratio - these are a few examples.  
Modernization is a harsh term to some. They think modern design has lost its soul and all the aspects that make something seem "personal" is lost - maybe it has, but let's first understand why these changes are made.

## Accessibility
Companies and designers want their product or service known: they need to gain as many impressions as possible. Keep the following in mind when creating a design accessible for everyone:
- **Color**:
- **Typography**:
- **Contrast**:
- **Simplicity**: (Target age, attention span, easy to read)
